# ðŸ›’ Online Retail Sales Database Design Project

## Introduction
This project involves designing a normalized relational database system for an online retail sales platform. The objective is to efficiently manage and analyze data related to products, customers, orders, and payments using MySQL. The system enables business reporting and provides insights into sales performance.

## Tools Used
- **Database System**: MySQL
- **ER Diagram Tool**: MySQL Workbench
- **Platform**: MySQL Workbench + GitHub

## Database Schema Overview

The database consists of the following five main tables:

### ðŸ”¹ `Customer`
Stores buyer information.
- Customer_ID *(Primary Key)*
- Customer_Name
- Email
- Address

### ðŸ”¹ `Products`
Stores product details and inventory.
- Product_ID *(Primary Key)*
- Product_Name
- Price
- Product_Quantity

### ðŸ”¹ `Orders`
Captures customer purchase transactions.
- Order_ID *(Primary Key)*
- Customer_ID *(Foreign Key referencing `Customer`)*
- Order_Date
- Total_Amount

### ðŸ”¹ `OrderDetails`
Maps products to each order with quantity and price details.
- Order_Details_ID *(Primary Key)*
- Order_ID *(Foreign Key referencing `Orders`)*
- Product_ID *(Foreign Key referencing `Products`)*
- Quantity
- Unit_Price

### ðŸ”¹ `Payment`
Tracks payments made for each order.
- Payment_ID *(Primary Key)*
- Order_ID *(Foreign Key referencing `Orders`)*
- Payment_Date
- Payment_Mode

> The database is normalized to **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to ensure data consistency and avoid redundancy.

## Sample Data
Each table is populated with realistic mock data to simulate real-world business transactions such as product purchases, customer orders, and payments.  
*I used ChatGPT to generate sample records for the tables.*

## Key Queries and Reports

The project includes several useful SQL queries, such as:

- **Customer-wise Orders**: Retrieve order history for each customer.
- **Product-wise Sales**: Analyze units sold and total sales amount per product.
- **Payment Summaries**: Display payment mode and date for each order.
- **Top 3 Best-Selling Products**: Find most sold products based on quantity.
- **Monthly Revenue Report**: Aggregate monthly sales revenue.
- **Customer Payment Details**: Combine customer, order, and payment info.

Queries utilize:
- JOIN
- GROUP BY
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT)
- ORDER BY
- LIMIT

## Views Created

To simplify frequent reporting, the following SQL views are created:

1. **Top_3_Best_Selling_Products** â€“ Lists the top 3 most sold products by unit.
2. **CustomerOrders** â€“ Shows each customerâ€™s order details.
3. **High_Value_Orders** â€“ Highlights product-wise sales volume and value.

## âœ… Project Features
- Fully normalized database (3NF)
- Realistic business use-case simulation
- Clean SQL code with joins and views
- Scalable foundation for dashboards or applications


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete MySQL-based database design workflowâ€”from schema creation and normalization to query writing and reporting. 
It forms a solid base for future enhancements like analytics dashboards, frontend integration, or data visualization using tools like Power BI or Tableau.
